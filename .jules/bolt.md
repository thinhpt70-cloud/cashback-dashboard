## 2024-05-23 - Separation of Sort and Filter in React Lists
**Learning:** In list components where users can both sort and search/filter, separating the sorting logic (O(N log N)) from the filtering logic (O(N)) into distinct `useMemo` hooks significantly improves responsiveness. By sorting the full dataset first (`sortedTransactions`) and then filtering that sorted list (`filteredData`), the expensive sort operation is bypassed during high-frequency filter updates (like typing in a search box), as `Array.prototype.filter` preserves the sort order.
**Action:** When optimizing list views, implement a "Sort First, Filter Second" data pipeline using chained `useMemo` hooks: `enriched` -> `sorted` -> `filtered`.
